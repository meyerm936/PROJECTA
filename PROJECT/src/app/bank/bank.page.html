      <h6>7. SWIFT:</h6>
    </ion-text>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">SWIFT is the coded means by which banks transfer funds and documents through wire process. What Is SWIFT? SWIFT is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. This organization operates a closed network which operates between banks and financial institutions for the purposes of exchanging messages relating to financial information. SWIFT was founded in Brussels, Belgium, in 1973 at a time when it was fast becoming apparent that globalization was a major market force, but banks in various countries were having trouble keeping up with the emerging demand for quickly and efficiently sending money and communicating financial information across borders. When it was first founded, the SWIFT network operated in just fifteen countries and had less than 300 banks and financial institutions associated with its network. Nowadays SWIFT operates in 208 countries and there are well over 8,000 banking institutions who make use of the SWIFT messaging network. SWIFT Codes SWIFT codes are simply a means of differentiating between different kinds of SWIFT messages. The SWIFT messaging network operates using a series of standardized message types. In order to send a SWIFT message, the banking officer simply fills in the appropriate information in the appropriate fields, and sends the message. In order to identify the different types of SWIFT message, there are numbers assigned to each of them. The ‘MT’ prefix stands for ‘Message Type’, and the three digit number that follows it represents a specific message type.</div>

        8. SWIFT CODE MT760</h6>
    </ion-text>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">The MT760 is a type of SWIFT message that is sometimes requested in trading because it functions much like a Bank Guarantee. Essentially, a MT760 is a SWIFT message which guarantees that a bank will make payment in favour of a client of another bank. When a MT760 is issued, the issuing bank puts a hold on its client’s funds, thereby ensuring that the funds are in place to make payment to the recipient of the MT760.</div>
    <div  style="text-align: justify;">The main difference between the MT760 swift message and the MT799 swift message is in when they are sent. The MT799 is sent before the MT760 and is a prelude to the sending of the MT760. Hence, the role of the MT799 is merely to notify and nothing else. This document is sent days or weeks before the sending of the MT760. It is important to note that the MT799 has no impact on the financial situation of an individual. This is another big difference that exists between the two documents.</div>
    <div  style="text-align: justify;">The MT760 swift message will impact the financial condition of a client since it a verification of freezing of funds by one bank. The MT799 swift message will have no impact on the financial situation of an individual since it is sent before the funds are frozen. This is another difference between the two documents. Another difference between the two documents is that the MT760 swift is sent after the sending bank has set aside the required amount of money. The MT799 is sent before the sending bank freezes the required amount of money in the purchasing individual’s bank account.</div>

      <h6>9. SWIFT CODE MT799</h6>
    </ion-text>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">The MT799 is a free format SWIFT message type in which a banking institution confirms that funds are in place to cover a potential trade. This can, on occasion, be used as an irrevocable undertaking, depending on the language used in the MT799, but is not a promise to pay or any form of bank guarantee in its standard format. The function of the MT799 is simply to assure the seller that the buyer does have the necessary funds to complete the trade. The MT799 is usually issued before a contract is signed and before a letter of credit or bank guarantee is issued. After the MT799 has been received by the seller’s bank, it is then normally the responsibility of the seller’s bank to send a POP (proof of product) to the buyer’s bank, at which point the trade continues towards commencement.</div>

    <div style="text-align: justify;">SWIFT MT-103’s is the most commonly used form of SWIFT communications, and one which many people will have utilized without even knowing it.
